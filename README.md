An Interactive Discord Music Bot created by Colby Hepworth as a personal side project. Features working buttons to pause, skip and play music, a dropdown menu to access all queued songs, and a working keyword search for music that accepts both YouTube and Spotify song links. Designed with object-oriented design principles in mind and implemented several data structures to handle the player, queue, controls, and songs in an object-focused way. Expanded upon and abstracted certain functions in the discord_slash library and found, diagnosed, and eliminated common edge cases.

Here is a short gif of it functioning:
